An NOAA dataset has been stored in the file : NOAA_dataset.csv
The data for this exercise comes from a subset of The National Centers
for Environmental Information (NCEI) Daily Global Historical Climatology
Network (GHCN-Daily). The GHCN-Daily is comprised of daily climate records
from thousands of land surface stations across the globe.
Each row in the datafile corresponds to a single observation.

The python code returns a line graph of the record high and
record low temperatures by day of the year over the period 2005-2014.
The area between the record high and record low temperatures for each day
are shaded.

Overlayed a scatter of the 2015 data for any points (highs and lows) 
for which the ten year record (2005-2014) record high or record low was
broken in 2015
